# Datatypes

ðŸ“Œ **Q: Why do we use `let` instead of `var`?**

- variables can be assigned without using `const` and `let` but it is not advised to do.

**Ans**: **`Var`** was previously used. The problem was var was not capable enough to deal with block and function scope. So when ever any developer used a variable multiple times js wasnâ€™t able to detect which variable is being mentioned so it would change both of the variables. **`let`** fixed this issue.

- Any variable without value assigned to it will be assigned with value **`undefined`**

We are going to look at some datatypes.

 `number`
 > 12 , 34 , 3,4

`bigint`
> 432434254423423432

`string`
> "My name is Khan"

`boolean`
> false , true


**`null`** 

- this is an **object**
- This is a standalone **value** this means the variable doesnâ€™t hold any kind value.
- Example: Supposed we tried to fetch temperature from frontend and we didnâ€™t get any temperature it will return us **null**.

`undefined` 
- it is a **datatype**
- Means datatype has not been defined yet.

`symbol`
- we use **symbol** for uniqueness (of `components`).

`Object`
- Holds values as `key:value`

ðŸ“Œ **`NaN`** means not a number. when we want to convert something  to a number but it isnâ€™t convertible to a number then we will get the value as `NaN` which means **Not a Number**.

```jsx
let score = "12b"
let scoreInt = Number(score)

console.log(typeof scoreInt) // This will tell you that it is a number
console.log(scoreInt) // This wil give you NaN(Not a Number)

// Number("33") -> 33
// Number("22ab") -> NaN
// Number(true) -> 1
```

ðŸ“Œ Empty string means `false`. Otherwise it means `true`

```jsx
let a = "khalid"
let b = Boolean(a)
console.log(b) // this will result in true

a = ""
b = Boolean(a)
console.log(b) // this will result in false 
```

---

ðŸ“Œ If a string is found somewhere the statement the following literals(string/numbers) will be treated as string

```jsx
console.log("1"+2) // 12
console.log(1+"2") // 12
console.log("1"+2+2) // 122
console.log(1+2+"2") // 32 [1 and 2 are numbers that is why they are added the moment we add them to "2" , 3 (1+2) also becomes a string. ]
```

ðŸ“Œ The **comparison** operator and **equality check** operator in JavaScript work differently.


ðŸ“Œ 
**===** means strict equal. This checks both **value** and **datatype**.

```jsx
console.log(2 == "2") // true
console.log(2 === "2") // false
```

ðŸ“Œ Avoid following conversions

```jsx
console.log(null > 0)
console.log(undefined < 0)
```


ðŸ“Œ Datatypes

1. **Primitive** (call by **value**)
    - String
    - Number
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
    - Symbol
    - BigInt
2. **Non Primitive** (call by **reference**)[These all are objects]
    - Array
    - Object
    - Function
</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ Symbol returns a unique value which helps us identify whether the value is unique or not.

```jsx
// Example

const a = Symbol("123")
const b = Symbol("123")

console.log(a == b) // false
```

ðŸ“Œ use `n` after end of a numeric literal. It will be converted to `BigInt`.

```jsx
let a = 234324343243243243243434324n
console.log(typeof a) // bigint
```

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ Objects hold value as {key : value} format.

```jsx
let myObj = {
	name: "khalid",
	age : 23
}
```

ðŸ“Œ All the non primitive datatypes are `Objects`.









<!-- Things I need to include
1. Repositories 
2. preli result 
3. update all the 2x with 3x
4. Correct "About me" & "connect me" section
